Walton College of Business. As an accounting professor with the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he made jaunts to the University of Arkansas for research and, on multiple occasions, to meet with doctoral students and give a presentation at the request of the accounting faculty. Allee soon became familiar with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arkansasstateparks.com\/devilsden\/\">Devil\u2019s Den State Park<\/a> near West Fork and <a href=\"http:\/\/crystalbridges.org\/\">Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art<\/a> in Bentonville. So, when he began working as a Walton associate accounting professor during the summer of 2016, he was already comfortable with his surroundings. His wife and five kids were sold as well.<\/p>\n<p>Allee says \u201cthere\u2019s a bazillion factors\u201d as to why he chose to work at the University of Arkansas, ranging from his freedom to do research to the camaraderie of his co-workers, with whom he often shares lunch.<\/p>\n<p>Yet accounting was an acquired interest. Allee, who grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado, thought he would be an entrepreneur because he liked the idea of working for himself. An inspiring professor at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, where Allee was an undergraduate, convinced him that the best way to learn about business was through accounting. Allee will pay it forward by enlightening undergraduates new to accounting by teaching Accounting Principles. He will also teach a graduate seminar in accounting research.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m grateful,\u201d he says of the opportunity to teach. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful I\u2019ll have the same impact on my students.\u201d<\/p>\n<aside><strong>Place of birth:<\/strong> Grand Junction, Colorado<br \/>\n<strong>My family consists of:<\/strong> wife (Jessica), three daughters (Alyson, Kourtney, and Ellary),

statements were more likely to be approved for loans.<\/p>\n<p>He was also the subject of a business story by the <i><a

showing that private firms can reap higher profits than public ones, from avoiding costs of regulatory requirements to enjoying tax advantages and the freedom from having to disclose information that could be used against them by their competition.<\/p>\n<p>His research has been published in the <em><a href=\"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1111\/1475-679X.12072\/abstract\">Journal of

on Major League Baseball Players\u2019 and Clubs\u2019 Performance.\u201d<\/a> As a graduate student at Indiana University, Allee was able to combine his interest in sports with accounting by presenting at The Cooperstown Symposium on Baseball and American Culture at the <a href=\"http:\/\/baseballhall.org\/\">National Baseball Hall of Fame<\/a> in Cooperstown, New York. \u201cIt\u2019s the best paper in the world that doesn\u2019t count for anything,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>What does count, however, is when Allee gets students to discover the many possibilities with accounting, just like a kindly professor did with him many years ago.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be an accountant in the long run,\u201d Allee says. \u201cBut it\u2019s a great place to start your

What you put into it is what you got out of it, like running a business.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Jumping into the world of startups hadn\u2019t entered Bjorn Simmons\u2019 mind. At least, not until Simmons\u2019 old classmate and friend from the Walton College, Stedmon Harper, invited him to do an experiential marketing campaign for a startup founded by Natasia Malaihollo, a University of California at Berkeley graduate. The three teamed up to participate in the 2014 South by Southwest (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.sxsw.com\/\">SXSW<\/a>) in Austin, Texas.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI found this world of startups \u2013 innovation meets entrepreneurship,\u201d Simmons says. \u201cI was fascinated and knew I had to be a part of it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the startup they presented at SXSW didn\u2019t take off, another one did. Within the next four months, Simmons left Atlanta along with his political career to move to Syracuse, New York, to launch with Harper and Malaihollo the startup <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wyzerr.com\/\">Wyzerr<\/a> (an edgy play on the word \u201cwiser\u201d), a software program that approaches online survey taking differently: it makes it fun, fast and easy like a game. Unlike many online surveys, which require participants to read questions and then answer by selecting radio buttons, Wyzerr has them performing activities similar to those found with video games as they answer the questions. As a result, the survey taker is more likely to answer several questions honestly within a short time span, enabling valuable real-time data.<\/p>\n<p>In their journey, Wyzerr continued to win both pitch and startup competitions and has been stationed in several cities in the United States, including Los Angeles, but found a home in Covington, Kentucky, located across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Ohio. There, Wyzerr participated in an accelerator program where the founders raised $1.5 million dollars and expanded their staff from three to 12. In developing their software, Wyzerr has worked with several businesses, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walmart.com\/\">Walmart<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unilever.com\/\">Unilever<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vw.com\/?&amp;cid=ssem_Ps29XwSi_71271193866_c\">Volkswagen<\/a>. Wyzerr will soon be public to all users.<\/p>\n<p>The path to Simmons\u2019 success began in North Little Rock, where he grew up and graduated from high school. It was also there where he chose marketing as a career. The University of Arkansas was on his \u201cwish list\u201d of schools to attend and won out when it offered Simmons a scholarship. His Walton classes provided him with valuable knowledge, including corporate marketing, retail marketing and inventory management, which he applies to Wyzerr now.

He tells people that if they have creativity in their hearts, and the desire to help others, don\u2019t waste any time.

Walton College of Business. \u201cI was confused about why the sheriff decided to pull me over while I was going 40 in a 40 zone.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe already had the speeding ticket printed out because an unmanned drone clocked me traveling 90 miles per hour 10 miles ago, and the sheriff was given the year, make and model of the car electronically. He was just waiting to pull me over.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>After a freshman year on campus without a car, contemplating complex airline flight plans or begging friends for a backseat ride home at Easter, Alley decided he had to do something about a simpler, cheaper ride if no one else was going to.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI asked myself, \u2018If there are more and more kids coming from the Dallas area that is six hours away, and most parents do not want to let their new high-school graduate drive a car to Fayetteville for the first semester, why isn\u2019t there an alternative service that students could use going and coming from campus to the Dallas-Fort Worth area?\u2019\u201d Alley said.<\/p>\n<p>Thus the birth of Hog Ride, U of A student transportation via Wi-Fi-enabled charter buses from Fayetteville to two park-and-ride locations in the Dallas Metroplex and back.<\/p>\n<p>Alley had planned to\u00a0kick off the bus services with a fall break trip but now is shooting for a launch over Thanksgiving.<\/p>\n<p>The Hog Ride buses have reclining seats, and the Wi-Fi will allow riders to do homework or enjoy surfing the web during the trip, Alley said. Passengers can reserve a specific seat on the bus through the Hog Ride reservation system, which is similar to an airline booking system. Passengers with reserved seats will get priority boarding. The reservation system requires riders to set up an account with Hog Ride.<\/p>\n<p>Students will be able to bring their own food and beverages on the bus, Alley said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHog Ride offers a transportation option that makes sense for college students traveling a few hours to and from campus,\u201d Alley said. \u201cThis option is safe, efficient and comfortable.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The plan is for the Hog Ride bus to\u00a0depart from Lot 56 on Razorback Road and depart from two locations in the Dallas\/Fort Worth area for the return trip.<\/p>\n<p>For details, pricing and reservations,
