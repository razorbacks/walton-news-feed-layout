Walton College of Business. <a href=\"http:\/\/walton.uark.edu\/directory\/index.php?id=mzweig\">Mark Zweig<\/a>, management executive in residence with the University of Arkansas, instructed his class to form teams and develop a business plan. Five of those students \u2013 only two of whom knew each other \u2013 combined forces and brainstormed. They quickly discovered they all had something in common: They loved pets.<\/p>\n<p>Then they made another discovery.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe all realized that animal shelters were underfunded in different communities,\u201d says Konrad Woelffer, a senior majoring in marketing management at Walton.<\/p>\n<p>The team came up with <a href=\"http:\/\/www.boxxyy.com\/\">Boxxyy<\/a>, a monthly subscription service for pet lovers. Visitors to Boxxyy\u2019s website can choose a box filled with treats and toys for either a dog or a cat starting at $25. For each box purchased, Boxxyy donates a customized box filled with supplies to an animal shelter in the consumer\u2019s area or where designated, says William Walker, a junior majoring in business management and Boxxyy\u2019s product research manager. The company, which launched in October 2016, began sending boxes to its customers in early 2017 after a successful Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign and is attending the 2017 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vegaspetexpo.com\/\">Vegas Pet Expo<\/a> in Las Vegas.<\/p>\n<p>The project began the previous August when the team hit the ground running, meeting at common areas in their apartment complexes or wherever they could find a table \u2013 in addition to going to school full time with a few having other jobs as well. William began looking for unique, quality pet products to fill boxes and pricing them. Nick Boyd, a management senior from Plano, Texas, researched the logistics of a mail-order business as Boxxyy\u2019s supply chain manager and Jordan Barrett, a Walton graduate student from Russellville, was named vice president of operations.<\/p>\n<p>Woelffer, Boxxyy\u2019s chief executive officer, came up with a blueprint for the website, which the team members all had a hand in building. Sanjay Jenkins, a senior majoring in management from Joplin, Missouri, and Boxxyy\u2019s vice president of sales, began strategizing.<\/p>\n<p>The team also visited animal shelters in Washington County to gauge their needs before venturing out to those in Little Rock and Russellville, all who are potential partners. William says while these facilities may be different, they all have the common challenge of operating on limited funding with the animals\u2019 minimum needs met, at best. \u201cA lot of time, the people in the shelters spend their own money,\u201d William says.<\/p>\n<p>A donated package filled with supplies could help ease the burden. \u201cOur goal is to grow and give back,\u201d Konrad says of Boxxyy.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s the name.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen you look at the Boxxyy logo, you notice the two X\u2019s and two Y\u2019s,\u201d Konrad says. \u201cThe reason for that is because for every boy, there is a girl. For every cat, there is a dog. For every box that goes to your home, there is a box that goes to an animal shelter.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Though the class laid the groundwork for Boxxyy, with Zweig offering guidance, they all say ingenuity is something you can\u2019t learn. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessarily what we learned in there, but how we apply it,\u201d William says.<\/p>\n<p>Nick admits there\u2019s a perk to working with Boxxyy \u2013 getting first dibs on trying out new products on his rescue dog, Sam.<\/p>\n<p>But the big picture is never out of sight. \u201cThe reason why we do this is that we just love pets,\u201d Sanjay says.<\/p>\n",

            "rendered": "<p>In the summer of 1976, Gerald Ford was president, Apple Computer Company was just getting started, a gallon of gas cost 59 cents, and Susan Imes Yell was a rising senior at Fayetteville High School. She was also a new part time staff member at the School of Law\u2019s Admissions Office. She worked half a day and, in the fall, went to school half a day.<\/p>\n<p>Little did Yell know that this part time job would lead to a 40-year journey at the University of Arkansas. She worked for the School of Law for five years, then joined the Department of Economics and the International Business Studies program, eventually becoming the administrative support supervisor for the economics department at the College of Business Administration, as it was known at the time.<\/p>\n<p>From 1976 to 2016, Yell has seen many changes at the university, especially with technology and its influence on student engagement.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cProbably the biggest change was the introduction of computers. Our department had the first one in the college,\u201d said Yell. \u201cIt required the use of floppy disks. The program was on one disk, spell check was on another disk, etc. That first computer was stolen, along with the printer and everything that went with it, when several people propped doors open from the second floor and went through the ceiling tiles into the main office. It took a while to get a replacement, since it was not covered by insurance. And, no one ever said you need to back up your work. Everything was lost and to my knowledge, the culprits were never apprehended.\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cAlways do the right thing, no matter what.\u00a0 And, if you see an injustice, do something about it.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Per Yell, technology has also changed the way staff members interact with students. With more centralized registration and other electronic processes, students spend less time engaging staff and faculty.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I first started, we would sit in the halls and hand out printed cards for registration.\u00a0 When you ran out of cards, the class was full.\u00a0 The students would then take their packets to the Union, to stand in a huge, long line to register,\u201d said Yell.\u00a0 \u201cLater, the U of A used the Hog Call system and students would register on the phone.\u00a0 We had to process overrides using this system.\u00a0 It would literally take weeks.\u00a0 We were very busy with students then.\u00a0 Now, with centralized advising and everything online, we don\u2019t have much student interaction, except with our graduate students.\u201d<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5681\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpressua.uark.edu\/business\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/126\/2016\/12\/2016-Susan-Yell-0280.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-5681\" src=\"https:\/\/wordpressua.uark.edu\/business\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/126\/2016\/12\/2016-Susan-Yell-0280-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Susan Yell\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">Susan’s office features hundreds of postcards from around the world sent by\u00a0students and faculty.<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Yet Yell does interact with students as evidenced by the hundreds of post cards adorning her office walls. Each day she works surrounded by post cards sent to her from around the world from students and faculty who have studied and\/or traveled abroad. She has collected them since the ’80s.<\/p>\n<p>She values the economics faculty and is impressed with their research and how much they care about their students. While she thinks they are one of the best things about the college, she has learned to say no when it comes to dissertations.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight after I first started working in business administration, one of my new faculty asked me to type his dissertation. Now, if you have ever seen an economics dissertation, you might know that it is FULL of equations. He showed me the first chapter, which was mostly text, so I agreed to type it for him,\u201d said Yell. \u201cOver the duration of my first pregnancy, I worked on it using a manual typewriter.\u00a0 It required using three different elements. So, when you would type text that took one element, an equation, one or two other elements. Every time there were any changes from his advisor, the entire chapter would have to be retyped, since there were strict rules about margins, etc.\u00a0 We joked whether I would finish the dissertation first, or would have my daughter first.\u00a0 I don\u2019t even remember who \u2018won.\u2019 I can laugh about it now, but it wasn\u2019t very funny then!\u201d<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI also cherish my WOW friends\u2026a group of ladies\u2026Women of Walton\u2026with whom I have remained friends for years and years\u2026and we still have lunch at least once a week.\u201d<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>While the faculty and students are one of the best things about work, Yell has experienced significant obstacles as well.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMy biggest challenge occurred when my department chair suffered a catastrophic accident,\u201d said Yell. \u201cIt completely changed the face of the department and my position.\u00a0 For a short time, I was in charge of the department.\u00a0 It was a very difficult time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Throughout the years, Yell has served on numerous committees for the college and has raised funds for local nonprofits. She is the departmental representative for United Way and has helped raise money for the American Diabetes Association, Big Brothers Big Sisters, University of Arkansas Staff Senate Scholarship fund, Northwest Arkansas Food Bank and Full Circle Campus Food Pantry among others. She was a member of the Walton College team on the Habitat for Humanity the House That Jane Built project.<\/p>\n<p>Yell has represented Walton College at the university level as a staff senator, staff senate secretary, staff senate scholarship committee, by-laws committee, elections committee, internal affairs committee, Employee of the Year for the university and Employee of the Quarter for Walton College.<\/p>\n<p>Yell was nominated for the Arkansas State Employees Association Outstanding State Employee Award in 2005 and 2010 and was chosen as a finalist in 2010. In 2006, the Department of Economics faculty established the Susan Imes Yell Staff Senate Scholarship in her honor. This scholarship was created to help promote and encourage staff development through higher education.<\/p>\n<p>After 40 years of service, Yell retired\u00a0from her job in December 2016.\u00a0She is married to Garlen and has two daughters, Erin, who teaches French at Springdale High School, and Sara, who is the manager of special programs in the Walton College Career Center. In retirement, she plans to spend more time with her family and her young grandchildren, Nora and Silas.<\/p>\n",
